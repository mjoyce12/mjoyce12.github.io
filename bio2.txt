The design world is brimming with fresh new talent, but I've been in the game for a while toiling away at a small, but mighty company that works on digital strategies for the greater good. I've had many titles over the years - instructional designer, e-learning designer, ICT project manager, user interface designer, senior program officer, senior learning strategist, HTML/CSS go-to-gal.

I call myself a Senior Learning and Design Strategist. I am strong team player who can help with user research, define technical requirements that solve sticky problems, listen and help generate ideas, prototype those ideas in Adobe XD or HMTL/CSS, support QA testing, and oversee and work on implementation.
