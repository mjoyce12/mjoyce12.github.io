     <h2>My Journey</h2>
	  <div class="card"><h2>Meet Me in Montana</h2> I spent half of my life living in Butte and studying in Missoula, Montana. Growing up in a large family in the Big Sky country undoubtably influences who I am, how I interact with others, and my design style. </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Learning through Travel</h2>
           I spent most of my 20s getting outside of my comfort zone. I studied abroad in Burgandy and Paris, France. I volunteered in East Harlem, New York City. I studied Chinese in Shandong, China and eventually spent two years teaching English and designing hotel newsletters in Taipei, Taiwan. Teaching, traveling, and designing shaped the person I am today.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2>Learning New Technologies</h2>
        I transitioned from my travels in Asia to what was then called the Silicon Forest - Portland Oregon. The internet was still relatively new and transforming everything. Working in tech support, I took one course at Portland State University and I knew I wanted to study educational technology. George Mason Unviversity's new Masters program in Instrucitonal Design and Development hit the mark. Here I built a foundation in learning and design.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2>TechnologY &amp; International Development</h2>
        An opportunity at the Academy for International Development in DC combined my love for travel, my passion to do good in the world, and my new found technology skills. I spent 5 years working on exciting USAID funded ICT-in-Education projects that took me to India, Jordan, Indonesia, Uganda and Kenya.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2> learning &amp; Consulting</h2>
        By the mid-2000s, I was ready to give my passport a rest. I took an opportunity at Booz Allen Hamilton to work as a Senior Learning Strategist. I designed facilitator-led training, managed e-learning venders and collaborated with bright and ambituous colleagues.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2> learning, Design &amp; International development </h2>
        By 2008, an opportunity to go back working on USAID-funded projects came my way. As part of a woman-owned, small business, I was able to hone my skills in not only in instructional design, but also HTML/CSS, user interface design and technical project managment. I've worked on projects focused on Gender Equality, Wildlife Crime, Water, Biodiversity, Sex Education, and Maternal and Child Health. During this time I also become a mother, a home owner and a pet owner.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2> looking for new opportunities  </h2>
        My goal is to find new opportunities that use my skills, my experience, and enthusiasm. I would love to be part of a dynamic and innovative design team working to help solve some of the world's most pressing and difficult problems. </div>
