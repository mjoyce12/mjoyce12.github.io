       <p>â€œI'm a senior learning and design strategist working with software developers and international development subject matter experts to build thoughtfully designed web applications and online learning that help clients make better decisions, improve their processes and implement more sustainable results.</p>
	       <p>My expertise includes technical project design and management of data-rich, custom web applications, instructional design, user-interface design, including high fidelity prototyping and implementation on custom Content Management Systems (CMS), KM, communications, and training support. I work on projects mainly funded by USAID, the World Bank and implementing partners, but also for non-profit and higher education institutions. I enjoy working collaboratively with computer programmers and our clients who are grappling to solve challenging problems in education, global health and gender equality.  My colleagues and clients have described me as responsive, productive, easy to work with, talented and resourceful. The tools I use daily include Adobe XD, Dreamweaver, Illustrator, Acrobat Pro for 508 compliance, Articulate Storyline, SVN code repositories, Jira for issue tracking, as well as online financial forecasting tools to manage budget and burn rates, collaboration, storage, and conferencing tools.  </p>
<p>Currently, I'm seeking opportunities that will allow me to continue my work in international development, or more broadly social good. I'm interested in diving deeper into user experience research and design, humane technology and social behavior change. My specific fields of interest are international development/foreign assistance, consulting, and higher education.</p>

     <h2>My Journey</h2>
	  <div class="card">
	    <h2><img src="images/montana.svg" alt="montana icon"/> Meet Me in<br>
Montana</h2>
       I spent the first half of my life living in Butte, Montana and received my Bachelor's Degree at the University of Montana in Missoula. Growing up in a large family in the Big Sky country undoubtedly influenced who I am, how I interact with others, and my design style. I still spend my summers in Montana.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2><img src="images/travel_pink.svg" alt="airplane icon"/> Learning &amp;<br>
Travel</h2>
        My 20s were about stepping outside of my comfort zone. I studied abroad in Burgandy and Paris, France. I volunteered in East Harlem, New York City. I studied Chinese in Shandong, China and eventually spent two years  in Taipei, Taiwan teaching English, and designing communications for a upscale hotel. Teaching, traveling, and designing shaped the person I am today.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2><img src="images/tech_green.svg" alt="mouse icon"/> Learning New Technologies</h2>
        I transitioned from my travels in Asia to what was then called the Silicon Forest - Portland, Oregon. The internet was still relatively new and transforming everything. Learning on the job as a tech support agent and taking coursework at Portland State University, I decided to  study educational technology. I moved to Virginia and received my Master's Degree at George Mason University in Instructional Design and Development. Here I built a foundation in learning and design. </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2><img src="images/international.svg" alt="resume icon"/> TechnologY &amp; International Development</h2>
        An opportunity at the Academy for International Development in Washington, DC combined my love for international travel, my passion to do good in the world, and my new found technology skills. I spent 5 years working on exciting USAID funded ICT-in-Education projects that took me to India, Jamaica, Jordan, Indonesia, Uganda and Kenya.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2><img src="images/consulting.svg" alt="resume icon"/>  learning &amp;<br>
        Consulting</h2>
        By the mid-2000s, I was ready to give my passport a rest. I took an opportunity at Booz Allen Hamilton to work as a Senior Learning Strategist. I designed facilitator-led training, managed e-learning vendors and collaborated with bright and ambitious colleagues.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2><img src="images/ux_gold.svg" alt="ux patterns icon"/>  learning, Design &amp; International development </h2>
        By 2008, an opportunity to go back working on USAID-funded projects came my way. As part of a woman-owned, small business, I was able to hone my skills in not only in instructional design, but also HTML/CSS, user interface design and technical project management. I've worked on projects focused on Gender Equality, Wildlife Crime, Water, Biodiversity, Sex Education, and Maternal and Child Health. During this time I also become a mother, a home owner and a pet owner.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2> <img src="images/new_ops.svg" alt="ux patterns icon"/>looking for new opportunities </h2>
        My goal is to find new opportunities that use my skills, my experience, and enthusiasm. I would love to be part of a dynamic and innovative design team working to help solve some of the world's most pressing and difficult problems. </div>
