     <h2>My Journey</h2>
	  <div class="card">
	    <h2><img src="images/montana.svg" alt="montana icon"/> Meet Me in<br>
Montana</h2>
       I spent the first half of my life living in Butte, Montana and received my Bachelor's Degree at the University of Montana in Missoula. Growing up in a large family (I'm the last of 12 children) in the Big Sky country undoubtedly influenced who I am, how I interact with others, and my design style. I try to go there every summer.</div>

        <h2><img src="images/travel_pink.svg" alt="airplane icon"/> Learning &amp;<br>
Travel</h2>
        My 20s were about stepping outside of my comfort zone. I studied abroad in Burgandy and Paris, France. I volunteered in East Harlem, New York City. I studied Chinese in Shandong, China and eventually spent two years  in Taipei, Taiwan teaching English, and designing communications for a upscale hotel. Teaching, traveling, and designing shaped the person I am today.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2><img src="images/tech_green.svg" alt="mouse icon"/> Learning New Technologies</h2>
        I transitioned from my travels in Asia to what was then called the Silicon Forest - Portland, Oregon. The internet was still relatively new and transforming everything. Learning on the job as a tech support agent and taking coursework at Portland State University, I decided to  study educational technology. I moved to Virginia and received my Master's Degree at George Mason University in Instructional Design and Development. Here I built a foundation in learning and design. </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2><img src="images/international.svg" alt="resume icon"/> TechnologY &amp; International Development</h2>
        <div class="bio-text">An opportunity at the Academy for International Development in Washington, DC combined my love for international travel, my passion to do good in the world, and my new found technology skills. I spent 5 years working on exciting USAID funded ICT-in-Education projects that took me to India, Jamaica, Jordan, Indonesia, Uganda and Kenya.</div></div>

        Consulting</h2>
        By the mid-2000s, I was ready to give my passport a rest. I took an opportunity at Booz Allen Hamilton to work as a Senior Learning Strategist. I designed facilitator-led training, managed e-learning vendors and collaborated with bright and ambitious colleagues.</div>

        <h2><img src="images/ux_gold.svg" alt="ux patterns icon"/>  learning, Design &amp; International development </h2>
        By 2008, an opportunity to go back working on USAID-funded projects came my way. As part of a woman-owned, small business, I was able to hone my skills in not only in instructional design, but also HTML/CSS, user interface design and technical project management. I've worked on projects focused on Gender Equality, Wildlife Crime, Water, Biodiversity, Sex Education, and Maternal and Child Health. During this time I also become a mother, a home owner and a pet owner.</div>
      <div class="card">
        <h2> <img src="images/new_ops.svg" alt="ux patterns icon"/>looking for new opportunities </h2>
        My goal is to find new opportunities that use my skills, my experience, and enthusiasm. I would love to be part of a dynamic and innovative design team working to help solve some of the world's most pressing and difficult problems. </div>
