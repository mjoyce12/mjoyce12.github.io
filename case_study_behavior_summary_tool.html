              <p><strong>Project: </strong>USAID ACCELERATE Project – THINK | BIG (Behavior  Integration Guidance)<strong> <br>
                Primary Audience: </strong>USAID Global Health Program Officers<strong> </strong></p>
              <p>In September 2018, I participated in the USAID  Think | BIG (Behavior Integration Guidance) Regional Training in Accra, Ghana.  One of my main responsibilities was to observe and user test the set of  web-based tools our team has been developing to support USAID program officers  in priority Missions around the world systematically integrate behavior change  thinking into their health portfolios with the goal of reducing the number of  mothers and children dying from preventable causes of death, such as malaria,  diarrhea, pneumonia, newborn illness, etc.</p>

	      <p><strong>Background:</strong><br>
	        Below is a brief overview of each of the Think  | BIG tools: (1) Prioritizing Behaviors; (2) Analyzing Behaviors and Creating  Behavior Profile s (3) Summarizing and Synthesizing Behaviors. <br>
	        <br>
  <strong>1.  </strong><strong>Establishing a List of  Priority Behaviors</strong>: This tool helps USAID Missions  prioritize a set of 6-8 life-saving behaviors that are appropriate for their  country&rsquo;s context. The behaviors should be tied to the USAID Mission&rsquo;s  development objective, their overarching health goal and be identified as most  proximal to addressing the causes of mortality. The Prioritization tool helps USAID staff  examine the causes of mortality and how they are related to behaviors. It also guides them to consider organizational issues,  stakeholder concerns, funding streams, etc.	      </p>
	      <p><strong>2. Analyzing each Priority Behavior by  developing a Behavior Profile:  <br>
	      </strong>With a list of priority behaviors, USAID Missions can now  analyze each behavior by selecting critical factors, both motivators and  barriers, that help or hinder the adoption of the behavior. Then they identify  the people needed to address those factors and finally they formulate program  strategies that can help overcome or leverage the factors. This analysis  facilitates a paradigm shift for many USAID Missions who often take an  intervention-based approach to changing outcomes. They are now using a  human-centered approach that looks at the realities of what influences people&rsquo;s  choices to make healthy and often live-saving decisions. The pathway to the  behavior-centered program strategies flow back to addressing the causes of  mortality and ultimately the Missions larger development objectives.</p>
	      <p>3. <strong>Summarizing and Synthesizing Behavior  Profiles</strong>: The last and most complicated tool, helps USAID Missions  summarize the set of behaviors by looking at commonalities across factors,  supporting actors and strategies. USAID Missions can use the tool to bundle  behaviors into categories that could maximize their resources and help  coordinate implementing partners working across their portfolio. Bundles may  include, &ldquo;Home-based Healthy Practices,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Facility-based Healthy Practices,&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Utilization of Routine Services.&rdquo;  In  most scenarios, 8 Behavior Profiles will generate 24 -30 Factors, Supporting  Actors and Strategies. Therefore, once it is organized in a bundle, the tool  uses a machine learning algorithm to categorize each factor, supporting actor  and strategy across the profiles and by bundle.   USAID Program officers can then examine each bundle with factors grouped  by the tool and rewrite the categories that align with a results framework.  They can also look at these across bundles. </p>
	      <p>In this case  study, we will look at the development and revamping of the Behavioral Summary  tool based on lessons I learned in the field. <br>
          </p>
	      <p><strong>The Behavior Summary Tool Testing and Redesign:</strong><br>
          The design of  the Behavioral Summary tool was initially conceived and socialized using Google  Docs with remote teams based in London, Singapore and DC. The prototype was handed  our team at Sonjara to implement along with the other tools. Once coded, it was  pushed out as part of the toolset.<br>
          </p>
	      <p>During the regional  training in Ghana, the session on summarizing and synthesizing behaviors did  not go well. The testing and observations uncovered some major flaws in  usability which many on the team perceived as flaws in logic or general utility  of the tool. &ldquo;Nobody gets it.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is too complicated for this audience.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is  it even appropriate for our core audience, USAID Mission staff?&rdquo; <strong>Clearly, we needed to take step back.</strong></p>
