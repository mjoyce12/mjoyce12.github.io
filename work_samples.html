	    <p>Sonjara built the Tennis Central web  application for desktop, Android and iOS  using Phone Gap  technology allowing for rapid application development and delivering a beta  version on all platforms within 6 months. Tennis Central is a place for tennis  enthusiasts of all skill levels to connect, sharing their love for all aspects  of tennis. It houses functionality for finding other tennis players and  available matches based on geolocation, and allows members to track their  scores, tennis progress, and upload photos; as well as improve their game with  a carefully curated set of video instruction courses.<strong></strong> I</p>

        <p><strong>USAID  Accelerate</strong><br>
      Sonjara is the primary technology partner  for a 5-year multi-million-dollar contract with the United States Agency for  International Development (USAID) to help reduce the mortality rates of mothers  and children under five in 25 priority countries around the world. Sonjara is  working with behavioral science and global health experts to design and develop  a set of online tools aiming to improve USAID&rsquo;s strategies and practices that  focus on behavior change. Sonjara has created online tools to facilitate  the project, including interactive content-driven tools, maps, data  visualisations and onboarding. Based on initial user inputs and stakeholder  requests, Sonjara is designing UI prototypes and revising complex workflows  using Adobe XD</p>

        <h2><img src="images/tech_green.svg" alt="mouse icon"/> Learning New Technologies</h2>
        I transitioned from my travels in Asia to what was then called the Silicon Forest - Portland, Oregon. The internet was still relatively new and transforming everything. Learning on the job as a tech support agent and taking coursework at Portland State University, I decided to  study educational technology. I moved to Virginia and received my Master's Degree at George Mason University in Instructional Design and Development. Here I built a foundation in learning and design. </div>

        An opportunity at the Academy for International Development in Washington, DC combined my love for international travel, my passion to do good in the world, and my new found technology skills. I spent 5 years working on exciting USAID funded ICT-in-Education projects that took me to India, Jamaica, Jordan, Indonesia, Uganda and Kenya.</div>

        Consulting</h2>
        By the mid-2000s, I was ready to give my passport a rest. I took an opportunity at Booz Allen Hamilton to work as a Senior Learning Strategist. I designed facilitator-led training, managed e-learning vendors and collaborated with bright and ambitious colleagues.</div>

        By 2008, an opportunity to go back working on USAID-funded projects came my way. As part of a woman-owned, small business, I was able to hone my skills in not only in instructional design, but also HTML/CSS, user interface design and technical project management. I've worked on projects focused on Gender Equality, Wildlife Crime, Water, Biodiversity, Sex Education, and Maternal and Child Health. During this time I also become a mother, a home owner and a pet owner.</div>

        <h2> <img src="images/new_ops.svg" alt="ux patterns icon"/>looking for new opportunities </h2>
        My goal is to find new opportunities that use my skills, my experience, and enthusiasm. I would love to be part of a dynamic and innovative design team working to help solve some of the world's most pressing and difficult problems. </div>
